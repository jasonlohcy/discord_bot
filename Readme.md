## Discord Emoji bot
*Bot is runned in Heroku*

Animated emoji is done through discord webhook as they still allow animated emoji from other servers and won't be converted to plain text. 
1. Bot will listen to command 
2. Delete the command in channel
3. Send the emoji through webhook
4. Replace webhook user and profile pic to the user that sent the command

#### Todo
  - All webhook channels are hardcoded. Could allow bot to create webhook themselve
  - Emojis could be moved into json file
